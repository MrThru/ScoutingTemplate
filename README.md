# ScoutingTemplate
A simple scouting template used for each season
A Scouting Template that is intended to be an easy to use template for the scouting team during the competition season.
# How To Use
Each year the new UI has to be made for the new game. For the UI buttons, premade functions such as "Increment Value" have been added.(Feel Free to make your own functions :)). The first thing you must do when creating a new Scouting Application is create a seperate repository and clone the Scouting Template files into the repo that you just created.
