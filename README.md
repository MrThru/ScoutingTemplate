# ScoutingTemplate
A simple scouting template used for each season
A Scouting Template that is intended to be an easy to use template for the scouting team during the competition season.
# How To Use
Each season all that needs to be done for the UI is update the field map, update input titles, and add/delete input fields as needed. For the UI buttons, premade functions such as "Increment Value" have been added.(Feel Free to make your own functions :)). The first thing you must do when creating a new Scouting Application is create a seperate repository and clone the Scouting Template files into the repo that you just created.
